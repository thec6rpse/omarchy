 # Omarchy with Ghostty + Zsh

My laptop default resolution is 1366x768 and because of that I have to replace ```font_size``` to 12

Adjusted only bindd ```SUPER + RETURN``` to start Ghostty as my main terminal (experimental).
 > If ghostty does not set  ```/usr/bin/zsh``` even with ```chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh``` reboot the system

Hyprland has been working really smoothier in this setup. Those config files will be here for the future.

> [!NOTE]
> Screensaver crashed my entire hyprland (Make snapshots after updating hypr*.conf)
